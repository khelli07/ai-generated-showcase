        <h1>About this work</h1>
        <p>
          Purpose: Promote Indonesian <b>AI-generated</b> arts about food,
          tourism, and culture <b>on an AI-generated platform/website</b>.
        </p>
        <p>We use 3 technologies here:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Text-to-text: ChatGPT, Github Co-Pilot</li>
          <li>
            Text-to-image: Midjourney
            <b>(able to text_and_image-to-image as well)</b>
          </li>
          <li>Text-to-video: HourOne.ai</li>
          <li>Text-to-audio: TextToMusic.ai</li>

        <h1>How we made it</h1>
        <p>
          We have 4 big components that are generated from AI&mdash;that we will
          cover at its own section.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Source Code</h3>
        <p>
          We use text-to-text to generate the code of this websites. Questions
          such as
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I want to make an art gallery portfolio, can you give me the folder
            directory tree for it?
          </li>
          <li>Can you generate the index.html and style.css for me?</li>
          <li>Can you fix the css so the photo is on 3x3 grid?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          are prompted iteratively to achieve our current web state.
          <b>However, do note that</b> human intervention are still needed,
          especially when the code is not working as intended since we might
          want to undo it. In addition, prompter also needs to understand the
          AI's response and instructions for the web to work properly.
        </p>

        <h3>Pictures and Contents</h3>
        <p>
          For the content of images, we use ChatGPT with prompt, more or less,
          looks like
        </p>
        <i
          >Please give me contents themed “Indonesian food” for showcase, with
          the following points.
          <ul>
            <li>Photo caption</li>
            <li>Short description</li>
            <li>Long / detailed description (1 paragraph only)</li>
          </ul>
        </i>
        <p>
          From this prompt, we use the short description as the input to
          generate the photo for the gallery. In other words, the flow is
          <b>
            prompt to ChatGPT &mdash;> get short description &mdash;> use short
            description as an input to Midjourney.
          </b>
          The photo caption, short description, and long description can be used
          as the gallery content.
        </p>
        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>
          The video is generated using text-to-video model HourOne.ai by giving text prompt 
          and setting the number of background scenes. The text prompt is retrieved from 
          text-to-text model ChatGPT. An example of the prompt is shown below,
        </p>
        <i>
          Write a script about Indonesia. Begin with an aerial shot of lush landscapes, 
          transition into diverse traditional dances, and explore iconic landmarks like 
          Borobudur Temple and Mount Bromo. Capture the splendor of pristine beaches and 
          wildlife, including the famous Komodo dragons.
        </i>
        <p>
          The model then generates relevant 
          images and descriptions text in accordance with the number of background scenes 
          generated. Upon playing the video, an AI presenter is automatically added to 
          elaborate more. Those components are compiled into a presentation resulting in 
          a video of animated scenes with descriptions read by an AI presenter.
        </p>
        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <p>
          Audio content is generated using text-to-audio model TextToMusic.ai by giving short text prompt 
          describing the music that we want. The short description is also generated using 
          the text-to-text model ChatGPT. One prompt example which result is being used is 
          <i>Indonesia: Treasures of Diversity and Wonder.</i> From one short description, 
          we can get multiple short audios at once. This audio is then played as a background 
          music for the website.
